# Documentation for this Data Mining Project

### This document will present background information about the project, the research methods used, and the conclusions reached.
#### Part 1: Project background

+ The company in the case had recently been suffering from customer churn problems, so they wanted to analyze customer data to identify the main causes of customer churn.
+ For a better analysis, I used RapidMiner Studio as the tool in this project.
+ RapidMiner Studio is a powerful data mining tool that enables everything from data mining to model deployment, and model operations. Its end-to-end data science platform offers all of the data preparation and machine learning capabilities needed to drive real impact across your organization.

#### Analysis method used in this project:

+ To achieve better accuracy, both decision tree and the logistic regression is used in this project.
+ To better illustrate, here's the image of the process:

#### Project result:

+ After both analyzing methods are used, here're the result and conclusion:
+ The most decisive predictor should be 'Compliants', or more precisely, Complaints with value = True. This is because it has the highest value of the standard coefficient and the Z-Value.
+ To better illustrate, here's the image of the result:
